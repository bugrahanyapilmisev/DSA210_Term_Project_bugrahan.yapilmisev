## Overview
This notebook focuses on visualizing and interpreting data to identify correlations between academic workload and chess usage. It includes preprocessing steps, statistical analysis, and a final hypothesis evaluation based on p-value and correlation metrics.

## Project Structure

- **Input Data**: Academic workload metrics and chess usage data.
- **Data Visualization**: Multiple plots including scatter plots and bar graphs to visualize trends and relationships.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Correlation calculation.
  - Hypothesis testing using p-values.

## Key Findings

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning and normalization were performed to handle missing and outlier values.
   - Data was categorized by workload intensity for comparative analysis.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plots highlighted potential relationships between workload and chess usage.
   - Bar graphs summarized data categories effectively.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Final Correlation: 0.09
   - P-value: 0.01370
   - Hypothesis Supported: Evidence suggests chess usage increases with academic workload.

4. **Results**:
   - Tables and analysis outputs are saved as JSON files for further use.

## Requirements

- Python (3.x)
- Libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Run the notebook to reproduce the visualizations and statistical findings.
4. Refer to the JSON files for a structured representation of the results.

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates a significant relationship between academic workload and chess usage, offering valuable insights for educational strategies and further research.
